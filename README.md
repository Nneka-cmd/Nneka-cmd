### Hi there this is Nneka's repository ðŸ‘‹


**Nneka-cmd/Nneka-cmd** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am a PhD student in the Soil and Crop Sciences Department at Colorado State University and a member of the [Crop Adaptation Lab or the Morris Lab](https://www.morrislab.org/) .

- ðŸŒ± My current research goal involves applying population genetic approaches to better understand the genetic architecture across sorghum breeding programmes to enhance the transfer of trait packages from public breeding programmes to private breeding programmes.
